An example of a Bernoulli process is coin flipping. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process)
A variable in such a sequence may be called a Bernoulli variable.

This example shows using the Binomial distribution to predict the probability of heads and
tails when throwing a coin.

The number of correct answers (say heads), X, is distributed as a binomial random variable
with binomial distribution parameters number of trials (flips) n = 10 and probability
(successFraction) of getting a head p = 0.5 (a 'fair' coin).

(Our coin is assumed fair, but we could easily change the successFraction parameter p
from 0.5 to some other value to simulate an unfair coin,
say 0.6 for one with chewing gum on the tail,
so it is more likely to fall tails down and heads up).

	Local flips:Int = 10
	Local coinFlip:TBinomialDistribution = New TBinomialDistribution.Create(flips, successFraction)
	
	' Then some examples of using Binomial moments (and echoing the parameters).

	Print "From " + flips + " one can expect to get on average " + nice(Mean(coinFlip)) + " heads (or tails)."

	Print "Standard deviation is " + nice(StandardDeviation(coinFlip))
	Print "So about 2/3 will lie within 1 standard deviation and get between " + ..

	Print "Skewness is " + nice(Skewness(coinFlip))
	' Skewness of binomial distributions is only zero (symmetrical)
	' if success_fraction is exactly one half,

	' Now we show a variety of predictions on the probability of heads:

	Print "For " + coinFlip.trials() + " coin flips: "
	Print "Probability of getting no heads is " + nice(Pdf(coinFlip, 0))
	Print "Probability of getting at least one head is " + nice(1 - Pdf(coinFlip, 0))
	
	' When we want to calculate the probability for a range or values we can sum the PDF's:

	Print "Probability of getting 0 or 1 heads is " + ..
		nice(Pdf(coinFlip, 0) + Pdf(coinFlip, 1)) ' sum of exactly == probabilities

	' Or we can use the cdf.

	Print "Probability of getting 0 or 1 (<= 1) heads is " + nice(Cdf(coinFlip, 1))
	Print "Probability of getting 9 or 10 heads is " + nice(Pdf(coinFlip, 9) + Pdf(coinFlip, 10))
	

	' Note that using
	
	Print "Probability of getting 9 or 10 heads is " + nice(1.0 - Cdf(coinFlip, 8))

	Print "Probability of getting 9 or 10 heads is " + nice(CdfComplement(coinFlip, 8))

	' does not use such a subtraction internally, and so does not exhibit the problem.
	
	' To get the probability for a range of heads, we can either add the pdfs for each number of heads
	
	Print "Probability of between 4 and 6 heads (4 or 5 or 6) is " + ..
		nice(Pdf(coinFlip, 4) + Pdf(coinFlip, 5) + Pdf(coinFlip, 6))
